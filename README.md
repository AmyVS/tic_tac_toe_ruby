#Tic-Tac-Toe

A project using Ruby Object Orientated design, it is just as the name suggests - welcome to our PVP version of Tic-Tac-Toe!

##Installation

Down in the bottom right where it says "HTTPS clone URL", just click on the little clipboard icon to copy the address. Hop on over to your command line, type "git clone" and paste the copied address. That should give you a copy of all the files.

Once you have all the files, just type "ruby tick_tac_toe.rb" in your command line to run the program and you should be good to go. Hope you like it!
